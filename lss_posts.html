  <p> <h1>Beginnings are hard. Especially for the Universe. </h1> <br>
    Welcome to the new, first, only place where you can look up to the immensity of the cosmic structures. <br>
    1. Why Last, why Scattering and why Surface? <br>
    The idea behind the name “Last Scattering Surface” came to me while I was studying for my Cosmology exam during my ongoing Master’s Studies in Astrophysics. <br>
    The idea behind the project is to talk about whatever fascinates me about the Universe. It’s going to be a long journey. <br>
    2. Do you feel like you should join this project? <br>
    Do you feel anything at all when you gaze upon the stars (abused expression, pardon me)? 
    If this is the case for you, here you can find something to enjoy yourself while gazing. 
    Whenever you decide to stop staring at the sky and decide to use the Internet, he said. <br>

  <p> <h1>But what is exactly the "Last Scattering Surface"? </h1> <br>

  <p> To understand why this project is called this way, 
       we need to clarify what means in Cosmology to have a surface of last scattering. <br>
       To get this, we need to understand what happens in the Universe - actually, 
       what happened in the first millennia of its life. <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> <br> 
       In this scenario, the Universe is characterizable as a relativistic<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> fluid. 
       In addition, every component interacts with every other, and the fluid is in 
       thermal equilibrium (there is not any heat flow). <br>

       As time passes, the Universe expands and cools down, rendering it possible for 
       electrons to bond with protons to form the simplest atom (spoiler - Hydrogen  atom). <br>
       This era of the history of the Universe is often called the “recombination era”, 
       even though there was not a previous time when these components “combined”. 
       So “recombination era” is just a funny name. <br>
       The components of the Universe at the time of our investigation are 
       primarily photons, protons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms. <br>
       Unlike the early days, a colder Universe is not fully ionized. 
       There are single charges freely flowing in space, and that’s why the 
       rate of scattering<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> falls. <br>
       When the rate of ionization has fallen, the photons have nothing to 
       interact with and don’t scatter with the matter, starting to “free stream” 
       into the Universe as it expands. <br>
       <div class="image-container">

        </div>
       </div>
       When the rate of ionization has fallen, the photons have nothing to 
       interact with and don’t scatter with the matter, starting to “free stream”<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> 
       into the Universe as it expands. <br>
       The Temperature of this “Cosmic Background Radiation” (CBR) is 
       measured to be: <br>
        <h4> T = 2.72548 K </h4> <br>
       where K stands for Kelvin (the only correct way to measure temperatures - 
       sorry Celsius, not sorry Fahrenheit). <br>
       We said that the CMB cools down with the expansion. 
       This means that when recombination started and finished the era 
       of matter-radiation interaction, the CMB had a different temperature. <br>
       One can calculate the time t this happened, the temperature T 
       at which this happened, and the relative redshift<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>. <br>
       Now, let’s be said that is not like CMB photons won’t ever interact with anything anymore. 
       It’s just that this won’t happen as frequently as when the radiation was coupled with matter. <br>
       So this sea of photons will continue to travel through the Universe as 
       it expands, cooling and expanding. <br>
       To visualize this surface, we could first try to look at the best image 
       we have of the background radiation (parametrized by its temperature) as 
       it is today. Here it is: <br>
       <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/LSS_posts/post1/univers-planck.jpg" alt="CMB" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;">
        <div class="caption">

          <div class="arrow"></div>
        </div>
       </div>
        We said that the temperature is almost 3 K: then why are there differences in this image, 
        and it’s not just one color? <br>
        That’s because there are indeed some little anisotropies, 
        due to various phenomena, but primarily because different parts of the Universe evolved in slightly different ways. 
        The different colors show that there are cooler and hotter parts of the Universe. <br>
        So what is the last scattering surface? It’s this huge wall of photons that continuously travel 
        towards the outer parts of the Universe (why, are there also inner parts of the Universe? Is there a center? ) 
        like an opaque window that renders it impossible to look beyond. <br>        
        That's it for today. 
        We hope to have motivated you to look upon this subject.

        here are some books/articles/links to enjoy.

  <p id="footnote1"><sup>1</sup>  With “life of the Universe” we technically 
    mean the time that flows from the start of the metric. 
  </p>
  <p id="footnote2"><sup>1</sup>  Relativistic means that its components have 
    energy almost entirely made out of their momentum and that their mass is negligible.
  </p>
  <p id="footnote3"><sup>1</sup>  Scattering is when particles (or particles and radiation) interact. <br>
    One example of scattering is aurora borealis, which happens 
    when cosmic rays interact with the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere - 
    in many ways - hence the many nuances of the northern skies. 
  </p>
  <p id="footnote4"><sup>1</sup>  free streaming is what happens when a component of a fluid 
    (i.e. the components of the Universe) does not interact anymore. 
    You can visualize it like this: interaction in an expanding fluid can happen 
    when the time the interaction takes place is lower than the time of expansion - 
    this is the time the fluid expands at some fixed velocity. But at some time 
    something happens and the role is reversed: now the time of interaction is 
    bigger than the time of the expansion. This means that it would take more 
    time for the interaction to happen than the time the fluid takes to expand. 
    So the particles don’t interact. 
  </p>
  <p id="footnote5"><sup>1</sup> redshift z is defined in general as the difference 
    between the measured wavelength of the radiation and the emitted wavelength, 
    divided by the emitted wavelength. <br>
    this quantity is often interpreted in Cosmology as being related to the 
    recession velocity of the Universe. We’ll probably talk about this some 
    other time.
