    <h1>space sound: Hallucinating Love by Maribou State</h1> 
  </p>
  I don’t exactly like electronic music. That is probably not true, but I like it blended with some other genre.
  I don’t really know where I’m going with this, so I’ll go straight to the point.
  I stumbled upon Maribou State through their first studio album, Portraits (2015).
  I saved one song in my Spotify favourite songs, then lost track of this duo.
  I caught myself listening in loop their second LP, Kingdoms in Colour (2018), this fall, but I did not connect the dots that those two LPs came from the same group.
  Last January, Chris Davids and Liam Ivorym, the two English musicists behind Maribou State released Hallucinating Love (2025), and it got in my feed (by then I had switched to Apple Music).
