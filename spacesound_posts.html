    <h1>space sound: <br/> Hallucinating Love by Maribou State</h1> 
  </p>
  <p>
  I don’t exactly like electronic music. That is probably not true, but I like it blended with some other genre.<br/>
  I don’t really know where I’m going with this, so I’ll go straight to the point.<br/>
  <hr>
  I stumbled upon <b>Maribou State</b> through their first studio album, <i>Portraits (2015)</i>.<br/>
  I saved one song in my Spotify favourite songs, then lost track of this duo.<br/>
  I caught myself listening in loop their second LP, <i>Kingdoms in Colour (2018)</i>, this fall, but I did not connect the dots that those two LPs came from the same group.<br/>
  Last January, <b>Chris Davids</b> and <b>Liam Ivorym</b>, the two English musicists behind Maribou State released <i>Hallucinating Love (2025)</i>, and it got in my feed (by then I had switched to Apple Music).<br/>

      Maribou State - Hallucinating Love (2025)

  Hallucinating Love seems festive since its beginning (<i>Blackoak</i>). It promises to go somewhere, and it delivers in the second part of the song.<br/>
  <i>Otherside</i> is exactly how I imagine clubs in the 1930s in a retrofuturistic utopia, and shares with <i>Peace Talk</i> the presence of <b>Holly Walker</b>, longtime collaborator of Maribou State. <i>II Remember</i> feels exactly like something you try to remember when someone clicks their fingers in front of you after you zoned out while they were talking; it blends into the next song (<i>All I Need</i>) that carries you once again in a safe space.<br/>
  <i>Dance on the World</i> starts almost Daft Punk-ish, then becomes the most danceable track on the record.<br/>  
  <i>Bloom</i> is another track where the rhythm and the cadence take you without hitting anything in particular to the next one. Peace Talk starts almost announcing some blending of Middle Eastern music with electronics, and it seems to exist only to be embellished by the voice of Holly Walker.<br/>
  <i>Passing Clouds</i> is an instrumental, and its position in the tracklist escorts you out of the club from which they will play the next song, <i>Eko’s</i>, that maybe should be listened to from a different room.<br/>
  <i>Rolling Stone</i> closes the LP, and it’s a hymn you should not be afraid to sing, together with those you listen to music with.<br/>
