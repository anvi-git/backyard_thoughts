            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            Hello, my name is Antonio and I'm a developer with a background in Physics and Astrophysics. <br>
            This website is the first I created from scratch.</a> <br>
            I'm building it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
        </p>

        <p id="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am a graduate in Astrophysics, and my Thesis contains this galaxy cluster (I had to zip it, though!):</p>
            <img src="https://cdn.esahubble.org/archives/images/screen/heic0813a.jpg" alt="This galaxy cluster is in my Thesis" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

            <p>I love to read books and articles, and to listen to music. Not necessarily in that order. <br>
            This is my <a href="https://github.com/anvi-git/Project_Book_library" target="_blank"> book library</a> on <a href="https://github.com/anvi-git" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, with numbers and statistics and stuff. <br>
            You will also find there a <a href="https://github.com/anvi-git/Project_Music_Library" target="_blank">music </a> library <br> 
            and a <a href="https://github.com/anvi-git/project_euler" target="_blank">math </a> library where I share my solutions for the <a href="https://projecteuler.net/archives" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>. <br>
        </p>
