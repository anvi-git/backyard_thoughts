  </p>
  <p> 
    1. Why Last, why Scattering and why Surface? <br>
    The idea behind the name “Last Scattering Surface” came to me while I was studying for my Cosmology exam during my ongoing Master’s Studies in Astrophysics. <br>
    The idea behind the project is to talk about whatever fascinates me about the Universe. It’s going to be a long journey. <br>
    2. Do you feel like you should join this project? <br>
    Do you feel anything at all when you gaze upon the stars (abused expression, pardon me)?

  <p>
    If this is the case for you, here you can find something to enjoy yourself while gazing.

  <p> <h1>But what is exactly the "Last Scattering Surface"? </h1> <br>
    <blockquote>
      und einsam <br>
      Unter dem Himmel, wie immer, bin ich. <br>
      Friedrich Hölderlin - Abendphantasie
    </blockquote>
    <h2> If you know, don't keep it to yourself! Go out and shout it to your friends and family. <br>
         If you don't know, wait until you have read this post. Then read again this subtitle.</h2>
  <p> To understand why this project is called this way, 
       we need to clarify what means in Cosmology to have a surface of last scattering. <br>
  </p>
  <p>  
    To get this, we need to understand what happens in the Universe - actually, 
    what happened in the first millennia of its life. <sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup> <br> 
    In this scenario, the Universe is characterizable as a relativistic<sup><a href="#footnote2">2</a></sup> fluid. 
    In addition, every component interacts with every other, and the fluid is in 
    thermal equilibrium (there is not any heat flow). <br>

        </div>
       </div>
  <p>
       As time passes, the Universe expands and cools down, rendering it possible for 
       electrons to bond with protons to form the simplest atom (spoiler - Hydrogen  atom). <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       This era of the history of the Universe is often called the “recombination era”, 
       even though there was not a previous time when these components “combined”. 
       So “recombination era” is just a funny name. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       The components of the Universe at the time of our investigation are 
       primarily photons, protons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       Unlike the early days, a colder Universe is not fully ionized. 
       There are single charges freely flowing in space, and that’s why the 
       rate of scattering<sup><a href="#footnote3">3</a></sup> falls. <br>
       When the rate of ionization has fallen, the photons have nothing to 
       interact with and don’t scatter with the matter, starting to “free stream” 
       into the Universe as it expands. <br>
  </p>
       <div class="image-container">

       </div>
  <p>
       When the rate of ionization has fallen, the photons have nothing to 
       interact with and don’t scatter with the matter, starting to “free stream”<sup><a href="#footnote4">4</a></sup> 
       into the Universe as it expands. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       The Temperature of this “Cosmic Background Radiation” (CBR) is 
       measured to be: <br>
  </p>
  <p>
        <h4> T = 2.72548 K </h4> <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       where K stands for Kelvin (the only correct way to measure temperatures - 
       sorry Celsius, not sorry Fahrenheit). <br>
  </p>
       We said that the CMB cools down with the expansion. 
       This means that when recombination started and finished the era 
       of matter-radiation interaction, the CMB had a different temperature. <br>
  <p>
       One can calculate the time t this happened, the temperature T 
       at which this happened, and the relative redshift<sup><a href="#footnote5">5</a></sup>. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
       Now, let’s be said that is not like CMB photons won’t ever interact with anything anymore. 
       It’s just that this won’t happen as frequently as when the radiation was coupled with matter. <br>
       So this sea of photons will continue to travel through the Universe as 
       it expands, cooling and expanding. <br>
  </p>
       To visualize this surface, we could first try to look at the best image 
       we have of the background radiation (parametrized by its temperature) as 
       it is today. Here it is: <br>
  <p>
       <div class="image-container">
        <img src="images/LSS_posts/post1/univers-planck.jpg" alt="CMB" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;">
        <div class="caption">
          The anisotropies of the Cosmic microwave background (CMB) as observed by the Planck space telescope. Image credit: ESA and the Planck Collaboration 
        </div>
       </div>
  </p>
        We said that the temperature is almost 3 K: then why are there differences in this image, 
        and it’s not just one color? <br>
  <p>
        That’s because there are indeed some little anisotropies, 
        due to various phenomena, but primarily because different parts of the Universe evolved in slightly different ways. 
        The different colors show that there are cooler and hotter parts of the Universe. <br>
        So what is the last scattering surface? It’s this huge wall of photons that continuously travel 
        towards the outer parts of the Universe (why, are there also inner parts of the Universe? Is there a center? ) 
        like an opaque window that renders it impossible to look beyond. <br>  
  </p>      
  <p>
        That's it for today.

  <p id="footnote4"><sup>1</sup>  free streaming is what happens when a component of a fluid 
    (i.e. the components of the Universe) does not interact anymore. 
    You can visualize it like this: interaction in an expanding fluid can happen 
    when the time the interaction takes place is lower than the time of expansion - 
    this is the time the fluid expands at some fixed velocity. But at some time 
    something happens and the role is reversed: now the time of interaction is 
    bigger than the time of the expansion. This means that it would take more 
    time for the interaction to happen than the time the fluid takes to expand. 
    So the particles don’t interact.

    <h1>space sound: <br/> Hallucinating Love by Maribou State</h1> 
    <h3>a duo from southern England that makes heartwarming electronic music</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
  I don’t exactly like electronic music. <br/>That is probably not true, but I like it blended with some other genre.<br/><br/>
  I don’t really know where I’m going with this, so I’ll go straight to the point.<br/>
  <hr>
  I stumbled upon <b>Maribou State</b> through their first studio album, <i>Portraits (2015)</i>.<br/>
  I saved one song in my Spotify favourite songs, then lost track of this duo.<br/>
  I caught myself listening in loop their second LP, <i>Kingdoms in Colour (2018)</i>, this fall, but I did not connect the dots that those two LPs came from the same group.<br/>
  Last January, <b>Chris Davids</b> and <b>Liam Ivorym</b>, the two English musicists behind Maribou State released <i>Hallucinating Love (2025)</i>, and it got in my feed (by then I had switched to Apple Music).<br/>
  </p>
  <div class="image-container">

      Maribou State - Hallucinating Love (2025)
    </div>
  </div>
  Hallucinating Love seems festive since its beginning (<i>Blackoak</i>). It promises to go somewhere, and it delivers in the second part of the song.<br/>
  <i>Otherside</i> is exactly how I imagine clubs in the 1930s in a retrofuturistic utopia, and shares with <i>Peace Talk</i> the presence of <b>Holly Walker</b>, longtime collaborator of Maribou State. 
  <i>II Remember</i> feels exactly like something you try to remember when someone clicks their fingers in front of you after you zoned out while they were talking; it blends into the next song (<i>All I Need</i>) that carries you once again in a safe space.<br/>
  <i>Dance on the World</i> starts almost Daft Punk-ish, then becomes the most danceable track on the record.<br/>  
  <i>Bloom</i> is another track where the rhythm and the cadence take you without hitting anything in particular to the next one. 
  Peace Talk starts almost announcing some blending of Middle Eastern music with electronics, and it seems to exist only to be embellished by the voice of Holly Walker.<br/>
  <i>Passing Clouds</i> is an instrumental, and its position in the tracklist escorts you out of the club from which they will play the next song, <i>Eko’s</i>, that maybe should be listened to from a different room.<br/>
  <i>Rolling Stone</i> closes the LP, and it’s a hymn you should not be afraid to sing, together with those you listen to music with.<br/>

    <h1>space sound: Middle Farm Session by Daughter</h1> 
    <h3>the new work by the trio fronted by Elena Tonra is a gentle wound</h3>
  </p>
  <p>
  Sad music is so good to listen to. <br/>
  I think many can relate, and it is particularly true when it is produced by someone that you can imagine are listening to their own sad music. <br/>
  <hr>
  <b>Daughter</b> falls in this category: the trio formed by <b>Elena Tonra</b>, <b>Igor Haefeli</b>, and <b>Remi Aguilella</b> is always on the verge of 
  cracking you up and making you cry, and does so by warmingly encouraging you to accept that not everything must be happy to be beautiful. <br/>

  They formed in <i>2010</i> and recently released an EP registered at the Middle Farm Studios in Dartmoor, <i>Middle Farm Session</i> (<i>2025</i>).
  I stumbled upon <b>Maribou State</b> through their first studio album, <i>Portraits (2015)</i>.<br/>

  </div>
  It starts as a conversation with <i>Future Lover</i>, where we get caught <br/>
  <i>listening for sweet nohings from ghost in the room </i> <br/>
  and Tonra presses us to answer her questions, “<i>what’s the future like?</i>”, 
  to which someone replies “<i>wait another year</i>”, and we’re just happy to be interrogated by her voice.<br/>
  <i>Party</i> is not a song you could party with, but could be the perfect score for an end-of-relationship-kind-of-conversation, 
  making that night “<i>the worst night of</i> [your] <i>life</i>”. <br/>
  <i>To Rage</i> is the perfect sequel to Party, where we’re left tracking the pieces left by those exhausting conversations 
  that explode, when someone storms out of the room and you end up “<i>distraught</i>”.<br/>
  <i>Be on your way</i> is the perfect therapy session you need after that, when you make sense of what happened, 
  of the planets that mark the distance between you two; and as long as you try to “<i>be on your way</i>”, 
  you’ll find it difficult to “<i>reconstruct the scene</i>”. <br/>
  <i>Dandelion</i> exits from that loop, and the music of Haefeli and Aguilella follows that more than ever, 
  lifting a bit up the rhythm: and it’s not “<i>a shame</i>” like Tonra sings, 
  because it’s a brief parenthesis that closes on <i>Isolation</i>, where we feel the coming to an end of the EP, 
  “<i>full-knowing we’re incomplete</i>”; and indeed the last song is <i>Neptune</i>, 
  where we come back almost full circle to the Tonra of <i>If You Leave</i> (<i>2013</i>), but Tonra here seems to be a bit more liberated to experiment with her voice.<br/>
  If you need to put some faith in a record, you should start with this one: in the end, there’s no-one out there to whisper answers. <br/>

    <h1>single space: 17 by Youth Lagoon</h1> 
    <h3> the day that you do is the day that you die </h3>
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>"it is a space I no longer inhabit, nor want to inhabit. Youth Lagoon is complete. I’ve reached the top of a mountain, only to then be able to see a much larger one I want to ascend."</i> <br/>    
  <hr>
  <p> <b>17</b> came from a complete project: it’s the fourth track on the first album produced by <b>Trevor Powers</b> under the moniker <b>Youth Lagoon</b>, <b><i>The Year of Hibernation (2011)</i></b>. The LP was followed by <i>Wondrous Bughouse (2013)</i> and <i>Savage Hills Ballroom (2015)</i>.

  <p>
  Powers sings that the day you stop imagining is the day you die (or at least this is what his mother told him): should this be connected to the publication of two new LPs since 2023, eight years after the statement that ended Youth Lagoon? <br/>
  It’s not why we’re here though - let’s not speak of the future. <br/>
  <hr>  
  </p>
  But where’s here, and when is it? The year is 2013 and the place is <i>Boise, Idaho</i> (coming - running away? - from San Diego, California).</br>
  Power finds himself with a <i>brain</i> that can <i>think faster than</i> [he] <i>can but not fast enough</i>, 
  and with thoughts that he’s sure would <i>lock</i> [him] <i>up</i> if spoken out loud.</br>
  He flees to his younger memories, where life was as fun as can be, going out hunting for snakes (too dangerous? - maybe that’s part of the fun), going out camping and swimming in lakes.</br>
  Produced alongside <b>Jeremy Park</b>, the song is delicate yet cadences the dreamy beat it also conveys in the lyrics: 
  you can instantly imagine Powers reminiscing his younger years, and when the drum beat comes in you get his thoughts 
  piling up and exploding, not too loud to make a scene, though.</br>
  <hr>
  Maybe we’ll come back to talk about one of Youth Lagoon’s last LPs, but for now, let’s hope he’s still having fun, like when he was 17.</br>
